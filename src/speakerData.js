She formerly led the Amazon Visual Search team in Atlanta, which launched visual search for replacement parts on the Amazon Shopping app in June 2018. This technology was a result of former startup Partpic (Atlanta) being acquired by Amazon, for which she was the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Prior to working at Partpic, she received her Ph.D. from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2014 and worked for a year with Exponent technical consulting firm in New York City. Her core research areas were digital signal processing, machine learning, and computer engineering. She received her B.S. in Computer Engineering from Mississippi State University (2007).

    Dr. Sephus is a native of Jackson, Mississippi and a 2003 graduate of Murrah High School/Power Academic and Performing Arts Complex (APAC). She’s had several internships and research experiences worldwide with companies such as IBM, Delphi, University of California at Berkeley, GE Research Center, GE Energy, Miller Transporters, and Kwangwoon University in Seoul, South Korea. Recently, Dr. Sephus became founder and CEO of The Bean Path non-profit organization based in Jackson, MS assisting individuals with technical expertise and guidance. During her leisure time, she enjoys playing tennis, playing the piano, listening to music, bargain hunting, biking, and working on do-it-yourself (DIY) projects at home.`,

        "A huge population of people are unaware of technologies that could benefit them, too intimidated to use technology, or have no one to show them how to use it. Yet, there are many avenues to break into tech. Through her personal journey of growing up in Mississippi, being CTO of a tech startup (Partpic) acquired by Amazon, and leading tech teams in corporate America, Dr. Nashlie Sephus encourages individuals of various ethnicities, backgrounds, and ages to be confident in embracing technology in their everyday lives. She embodies this message through nonprofit, The Bean Path, and discusses how to get free tech help."

      Testing complex async code can be challenging. But if we're using RxJS, there's a lesser-known feature we can use to make things much easier on us: the TestScheduler. Together, we can deterministically virtualize time using a declarative ASCII marble diagram.
      
      In this talk, we'll first briefly cover what RxJS is, then focus on the various patterns for testing your RxJS code, including using the TestScheduler and the syntax of ASCII marble diagrams.`

      This talk is designed to help shine a light on some of the recent additions that you might not be aware of, that can be really useful in your everyday code.
      
      Topics include new data structures, new prototype methods on our favorite objects, asynchronous iteration, and new operators.`

      description: `When you think of low vision, what comes to mind? A user that is near sighted? How about far sighted? Maybe partially blind? These are all qualifying cases of poor vision, but low vision is more complicated than the prescription of glasses or contacts.

      According to the World Health Organization, they categorize low vision based on specific levels of visual acuity and field of vision ([W3.org](http://w3.org/), 2016). With that in mind, we as developers can look at different categories of low vision including color vision, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, etc and make an effort to bake in things like zoom, non-conflicting colors, and re-wrapping of columns in to our code.
      
      My talk will cover what vision accessibility is, different categories of low vision, what the needs of the users are, and what we as developers can do to achieve a great user experience for low vision users.`

      In this talk, I’ll show how we can rebuild tools like Wordpress as well as Ecommerce sites using React, Gatsby, GraphQL and serverless technologies. I’ll walk through the build process, discuss how we can package and deploy the full stack that includes authentication, authorization, signed images, and database tables with just a few commands, giving users the power of wordpress with the elegance of React, Gatsby, and Serverless technology.`

Twitter in particular has a highly-active development community which gives developers the capability to learn, and contribute at a rapid pace aiding in the development of newfound, and updated ideas.
