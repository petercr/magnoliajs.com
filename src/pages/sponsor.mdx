## Interested in Sponsoring?!

We are a developer conference coming to the Jackson, MS area with a focus on web-based technologies. We also happen to be Mississippi's _only_ developer conference!
Last year, we welcomed a diverse group of approximately 150 guests at the Jackson Convention Complex to learn about new and exciting things in web development. 
This year, our mission is to bring together around 250 web developers and friends to learn new skills and concepts
and to network and develop new relationships. With this conference, we want to contribute to the cultivation of a welcoming, inclusive,
and dynamic tech scene throughout the Southeast and beyond, as well as give visitors a positive Mississippi experience to help foster growth in our local tech community.

Here's your chance to contribute to that mission! We're looking for the best companies to partner with us and help to make the
Second Annual MagnoliaJS Conference a success. And with your contribution, it will be!

Our team has created opportunities for sponsorship at a number of levels to make it easier for you to support our team of volunteers
in bringing this about.

None of these sponsorship tiers fit your needs? Have more questions? Reach out to the Sponsorship team at <a href="mailto:jc+magnoliajssponsor@jchiatt.com">jc+magnoliajssponsor@jchiatt.com</a>.

We can work together to come up with a custom sponsorship package that will work for you!
