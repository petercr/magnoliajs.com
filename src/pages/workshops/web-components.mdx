Come learn about Web Components with friends!

Web Components are native browser APIs that let you develop rich UI components with `0KB` of added bundle size! In this workshop I want to convince you that you **might** not need a framework.

We will walk through Web Component implementations of the sample components from reactjs.org:

- Hello World
- Timer
- Todo List
- Markdown Preview

As we develop these components we will highlight various pieces of the Web Components:

- `customElements`
- `<template>`
- The Shadow DOM
- ES6 Modules

After we get off the ground with Web Components, we'll dive down the rabbit hole with [Svelte](https://svelte.technology). Svelte is "The magical disappearing UI framework." It is a project that abstracts over Web Components by compiling Svelte code down to vanilla Web Components without any runtime. So it is still `0KB`!

If that sounds wacky, come along for the ride to see how it works!

If you aren't comfortable with ES6, that is OK. Bring a buddy! Pairing is encouraged.

**Prerequisites:** You should be comfortable with HTML/CSS/JS. #UseThePlatform

**Preparation:** Please bring a laptop with a modern browser and your favorite editor.
